A Repo containing supplementary material for the article "An iterative topic model filtering framework for short and noisy user-generated data: Analyzing conspiracy theories on Twitter"

The folder TTMonitor contains the LDA implementation used by us, which includes data preprocessing and tweet pooling. The script used for the main analysis of the paper is called "Conventional_Iterative_Filtering_Experiment_Blueprint_US.ipynb". Under the following link the user can find a list of all Tweet-IDs of the tweets used as the base dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wdJKdEmjtTPg09t_-8S52FVR5zHIUpM5/view?usp=sharing
